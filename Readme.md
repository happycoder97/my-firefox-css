# Firefox userChrome.css tweaks

I was watching @jonhoo 's youtube stream on implementing TCP in Rust and got

* Brings the navbar to bottom, like @jonhoo's. 
* Make everything more compact.
* Tame the ugly megabar. Yep it is ugly.
* Move megabar up on focus so that it doesn't overflow the screen.


## Install

Clone into `~/.mozilla/firefox/<profile-id>.default/chrome`.
